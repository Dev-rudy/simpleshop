		       <h1 class="blog-head">Ultimate Freecash App Review: Legit or Scam? (After 20-Days-In)</h1>
			   <p class="blog-desc">A website called Freecash.com (formerly known as Freeskins.com) 
			   advertises that by doing various online microtasks, users can earn cash, cryptocurrency,
			   and free skins. It’s a rather easy way to make money. At the very least, they guarantee it.<br>
			   <span class="high-light"><i>But is Freecash a legitimate option for making extra money online, or is it a fraud to avoid?</i></span><br>
			   <span class="cut-off"> What exactly is Freecash.com and what services does it provide?</span><br>
			  <b> Earn money with Freecash’s Paid Offers</b><br>
Paid offers are one of the finest ways to earn money on Freecash. These offers can be found in the Offer Walls area.<br>
These paid offers will typically require you to complete a survey or quiz, play a mobile game, download a mobile app,
 sign up for a website, and a variety of other tasks. Every paid offer on Freecash’s offer walls will tell you how many
 coins you will receive. As a result, you can easily prioritize which offers to accept.<br>

One thing to include as a personal impression is that I did observe that Freecash does not have as many offer walls as 
some other GPT sites. However, the ones they have will give you access to a wide range of offerings. The good news is 
that most of their offer walls have reasonable payouts. As a result, completing these compensated offers will allow you
 to earn decent pocket money. In fact, I compared the rewards they provide to some of the greatest paying GPT sites, and
 in most cases, Freecash pays far more for identical offers.<br>
 <i style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Also, they occasionally give bonuses, such as a 50% bonus on any offers you take on a specific offer wall for a limited period.
 This is something to keep an eye out for because it has the potential to significantly increase your earnings. </i><br>
 Furthermore, Freecash provides something that I have not seen on other GPT sites. They have a section called featured
 offerings at the very top of the dashboard. This section shows the highest-paying tasks completed by Freecash users in
 your nation. This makes it much easier to identify the offers and surveys you’re most likely to complete and earn money 
 from. So, in my opinion, this is a lovely little extra touch.<br>
 <span class="cut-off">Earn prizes with Freecash’s Paid Surveys</span><br>
 You can also earn money through Freecash by taking paid surveys.
  <i style="color:red;font-weight:bold">The paid surveys, like their paid offers, will come from other platforms.</i><br>
  Their paid surveys are similar to offer walls in certain ways. The only difference is that instead of sponsored offers,
  you will have access to various surveys. Before you can respond to a survey, you must first create a profile. This is to
  select which surveys will be sent to you. After you’ve finished answering their profile questions, you’ll be able to access
  the surveys. Every survey will inform you how long it will take to finish it and what reward you will receive for completing it. 
  So, if you are short on time, you can just select surveys that are quick to complete.<br>

When you click on a survey, you will be asked a series of qualifying questions. This is to see if you fit the demographic for which
 the survey is designed. If you qualify, you will be able to take the actual survey. If you do not qualify, you must just go on to 
 the next open survey.<br>
  <i style="color:red;font-weight:bold">One advantage of their survey system is that the more surveys you complete, the more high-paying 
  surveys you will be offered. As a result, it will be more useful to complete as many questionnaires as feasible.</i><br>
  One thing to keep in mind about this earning possibility is that some survey routers will only be available after you’ve earned a particular
  quantity of coins. In comparison to many other sites, the surveys on Freecash.com pay rather significantly for your time. Yet, you must remember,
  as with many other GPT and survey sites, that you will not qualify for all surveys. That is completely normal, so don’t be discouraged if you don’t
  qualify for any surveys. Just keep going until you locate available ones, which normally offer fairly good rewards.<br>
<span class="cut-off">Earn cash with Freecash’s Referral Code Program</span><br>
You can gain extra points by inviting others to join their site. This is known as a referral scheme.
 All you have to do is share your invite referral link, and whoever joins up using your link will become your referral.<br>

According to the official website, you will get 5% of anything they make on the site, which will be borne by Freecash. 
It will not be taken from the revenue of your referral. In addition, your referral will earn 100 coins as a welcome bonus
 for signing up using your link. So it’s a win-win situation for both of you.<br>
<span class="cut-off">Earn extra with Freecash’s Leaderboard Contests</span><br>
If you are active on the site, Freecash is a terrific method to earn extra money. In addition to all methods above, it offers daily 
and monthly leaderboard competitions. At the time of writing, they are giving away free coins to the top 250 persons on the leaderboards.
 And some of the rewards are really significant, with thousands of dollars given out every month. This is something to keep an eye
 on because you can make some pretty nice extra money by remaining active and winning a portion of these awards.<br>
 <span class="cut-off">Earn money by staying active on Freecash.com</span><br>
 You can obtain free coins by just clicking a button on Freecash’s incentives area. As long as you remain active on the site, you can 
 click this once per day to receive some free money. The more days you complete this in a succession, the larger the award. <br>

You can also choose between taking the free coins every day or using the daily bonus ladder to increase your chances of winning even
 more. In the latter case, you also run the danger of not receiving the points if you use this, but if you’re lucky, you can quadruple 
 your free points, and, after enough days in a row, you can even win more than $5 just by clicking a button like this. So this is an
 option worth remembering to look at because it only takes a few seconds.<br>
 <span class="cut-off">Earn prizes with Freecash’s Promo Codes</span><br>
 Last but not least, you can locate Freecash promo codes to receive some additional easy free points. The website admins frequently post 
 these several times every week on their social media channels. They won’t give you many points, but all you have to do is enter the promo 
 code in the bonus code form in the reward section, which will just take a few seconds.<br>
 <i style="color:red;font-weight:bold">You should be aware that these codes are usually only available to a few people, so you must act quickly to obtain the points.</i><br>
   <br> <span class="cut-off">if you want to know more  please follow the link citation bellow</span>

<span class="high-light">remember: we do not recomend  that you use this money earning app as an excuse for quiting your job or replacing your job<br>
                        only use this when you have free time ,maybe waiting on a bus stop,waiting on dining ,etc  not full time  <br>
					  because  the long hours on this app does not guarantee to make a living (just extra cash) </span>

		  <h1 class="blog-head">Alison Review</h1>
		  <p class="blog-desc">
		     <span class="high-light">Comprehensive Alison Review Created by Analysing the Most Important E-Learning Aspects</span><br>
			 Nowadays, people tend to independently learn skills that they’re missing or need in order to have more job opportunities. 
			 Lately, the number of online education platforms is growing rapidly, and we might face problems when choosing the right online 
			 education platform for ourselves. Well, in this Alison review, I'll discuss one of the more well-known alternatives.<br>

Of course, since we all have different abilities and skills, what works for some people might not work for others. In addition, before 
enrolling in a course, people tend to search for more detailed information about courses in order to understand whether or not they’re worth the time.<br>

To help you decide, I will provide a thorough description of user Alison reviews, and pitch in one of my own, which, hopefully, will be exactly what you need.
 Before moving to one of the Alison reviews, I will explain what Alison is, what it does, and why it does it, and also how many people are connected to this platform.
 Moreover, how many and what types of courses Alison provides.<br>

Also, you could check out some Alison alternatives, too - platforms such as Udemy, edX, Coursera or even Udacity might be a great fit for your wants and needs!<br>
<span class="cut-off">Pros</span><br>
Free courses<br>
Easy to use<br>
Good content<br>
A wide variety of courses to choose from<br>
<span class="cut-off">Cons</span><br>
Pay in order to remove ads<br>
Might not work for iOS users<br>
<span class="cut-off">Firstly, what is Alison?</span><br>
Alison is a free online education platform that mostly focuses on job-applicable skills. It was founded in Galway, Ireland by Irish social entrepreneur Mike Feerick on 21 April 2007.<br>

At the moment, Alison offers over 2500 free online courses, it has about 19 million learners and 3 million graduates from 195 countries. So, I believe it is safe to say that the numbers speak for themselves, right?<br>

Alison’s team consists of representatives from 14 countries across 6 continents worldwide! All of these people, who are dedicated marketers, publishers, analysts, and technologists, have gathered for one purpose - providing free learning courses!<br>

Now, as it is clear what Alison is, I will move on to my interpretation of Alison courses review and its ease of use, which is the first thing that you notice after opening the web page.<br>
<span class="cut-off">Ease Of Use</span><br>
One of the most crucial elements of Alison.com reviews is its ease of use. Everyone knows that the first impression matters. Web pages are no exception. As you take a look, you can see right away whether a design is attractive and fulfills your expectations or, 
on the contrary, is chaotic and tacky. Also, it is important to not get overwhelmed by all the additional information, which is irrelevant to you. So - let’s see which of the previously mentioned cases is Alison.<br>

Before starting to write one of many Alison online courses reviews, I opened Alison's website and noticed that it has an attractive design. The colors are quite neutral, and it has a simple layout, with the slogan in the corner: 
“Empower Yourself”. On the top of the page, you can find the dropdown menu, which is quite common.<br>
<a href="https://alison.com/?utm_source=alison_user&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_campaign=11682105"target="_blank"><img src="https://assets.bitdegree.org/online-learning-platforms/storage/media/alison-review-features.o.jpg" alt="alison review img sample" class="blog-img" /></a><br>
On the right side, there are categories, which are provided in a clear visual way. They include technology, language, science, health, humanities, business, math, marketing, and lifestyle. When scrolling down you can also see extra categories that actually make it easier for you to decide which course to choose.

They include: trending now, most popular, and most recent. So far, everything is clear, right? Also, it is important to mention in Alison.com reviews that the page seems to exclude all the unnecessary information, which would only interfere with your user experience.

Moving further with Alison reviews, let’s see how you can enroll in one of the courses. So, when it’s time to decide the course that you'd like to enroll in, you’ll notice that each course is evaluated by your fellow colleague students. These evaluations come in the form of bottom-of-the-page user reviews and stars - a popular method of discussing various different content types.

Also, there is information presented on each course, saying whether you will get a diploma or certificate after completing it, and that’s definitely information that’s worth including in an Alison courses review. What is more, you can save whichever course you want in order to get back to it later.

When reading through user Alison.com reviews, the first negative thing that caught my eye was that an advertisement popped out after I selected the course. So it turns out that you have to wait 10 seconds for it to load up. And it happens when moving to further lessons of the same course, as well. If you want to discontinue advertisements, you can go premium, which costs $7,99 per month.
<br>
<a href="https://alison.com/?utm_source=alison_user&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_campaign=11682105"target="_blank"><img src="https://assets.bitdegree.org/online-learning-platforms/storage/media/alison-review-courses.o.jpg" alt="alison review img sample"class="blog-img" /></a><br>
Even though the price is not that big to remove ads, I guess it’s safe to say in this Alison course review that 10 seconds is not such a long time to wait.

Furthermore, when reading through Alison reviews left online, I noticed some negative feedback from iOS users. After doing my research, I found out that iOS devices (such as iPad or iPhone) are not optimized for the Alison website, and might cause issues with your progress since it can fail to update.

Moreover, it is important to mention in all of Alison online course reviews that if you’re using an Android tablet or mobile device, problems with incompatibility may appear. It is so if the course that you’re watching is not optimized for the Alison Android app. Then again, these are very minor issues - you can check the courses on any type of device, at any given point in time.<br>
<a href="https://alison.com/?utm_source=alison_user&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_campaign=11682105"target="_blank"><img src="https://assets.bitdegree.org/online-learning-platforms/storage/media/alison-review-featured.o.jpg" alt="alison review img sample" class="blog-img" /></a><br>
To quickly go through the previously-mentioned information I read in some of the user Alison course reviews, I would say that I really liked the design of Alison - it was simple and pretty at the same time, everything was clear and easy to use, no colors that could poke your eyes and no unnecessary information.

The only notable thing worth mentioning as far as user complaints are concerned are the ads - they can get pretty annoying, real fast! However, there's a way to remove them - all you need to do is order the Premium plan of the MOOC provider.

Also, Alsion might not support many iOS and mobile devices, though this is an issue that is being addressed - at the time you're reading this Alison review, chances are that the situation has improved significantly.<br>
<span class="cut-off">Content Quality</span><br>
Content quality is one of the major aspects to which everyone pays (or, at least - should pay) attention to. That’s why one of the questions that appear most frequently in Alison online course reviews, is whether Alison online courses are good enough? So, in this Alison online course review, I will do my best to answer this question.

The majority of Alison online course reviews are very positive. Most users claim that Alison’s courses were useful and provided them with a set of new skills, and should be considered as micro-courses.

However, some users who wrote Alison online courses reviews claimed that courses are not that serious from a long-term perspective. All in all, taking into consideration that they are free, the majority of users were satisfied.

Course topic-wise, you'll be able to find anything from programming and web development up to writing and other arts - a broad selection!<br>
<span class="cut-off">Price</span><br>
The price is something that each user pays attention to when they choose the right online course for themselves. Many people prefer online courses to live ones, simply because they’re usually cheaper and, sometimes, you can benefit from them even more. Now, in this Alison online courses review, I would like to put emphasis on the price because Alison courses are totally FREE, anywhere, any time.

After I put it this way, I guess you might want to ask: then why would you include price to Alison online course reviews? The answer is quite simple. Even though courses are free, if you want to get a diploma or certificate, you must pay for it.

How much do Alison’s certificate and diploma cost?

There are a few different aspects I would like to include into my version of Alison online course reviews when paying attention to the price. Certificates can cost from €12 to €35, it depends on whether you choose digital, printed, or framed certificate.<br>
<a href="https://alison.com/?utm_source=alison_user&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_campaign=11682105"target="_blank"><img src="https://assets.bitdegree.org/online-learning-platforms/storage/media/alison-review-testimonial-5f60bee82319a.o.jpg" alt="alison review img sample" class="blog-img" /></a><br>
Diplomas are more expensive - they cost from €39 to €75, and if you want to get Learning Path, which are e-learning activities taken by a learner, you will be asked to pay from €149 to €165. So, it’s your decision to make whether you think it’s worth the price, and, hopefully, after Alison online course reviews, you will have a strong opinion about it.

My opinion on the matter? Well, if you've spent any time researching other online learning platforms, and the costs of the diplomas that they tend to issue, you can probably already tell that Alison's prices are great. The certificates are extremely affordable!

What else you should pay for in order to get maximum experience?

As I mentioned before in my Alison online course reviews, in order to remove ads, you will have to pay the price. If you go premium and pay €7 per month, all adverts will be removed, also you will get up to 50% off certification. Moreover, you can pay a one-time fee of €50 if you want to remove ads from courses only and a €99 fee if you want to remove ads from the entire website. Note that it is only valid for one account and for a one-year duration.

To conclude this part of Alison online course reviews, I would say that the prices of Alison's certificates are truly on the low side of things. The certificates will be valuable both if you’re studying for your own good, or if you need a document that proves you successfully finished courses that you might need to show to your future employer.

Moving further to other important aspects of Alison online course reviews, I will pay attention to the learning experience and features.<br>
<span class="cut-off">The Learning Experience</span><br>
This part of Alison course review is the one that everyone understands and evaluates differently. It depends on your style and usage preference, and your overall mood that day. Also, you might have different expectations from online courses than other users, so you can either get disappointed or surprised by how great your learning experience was.

However, there’s still a possibility to develop an overall impression of Alison courses.<br>
<a href="https://alison.com/?utm_source=alison_user&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_campaign=11682105"target="_blank"><img src="https://assets.bitdegree.org/online-learning-platforms/storage/media/alison-review-course-5f60bf0e134c3.o.jpg" alt="alison review img sample" class="blog-img" /></a><br>
First of all, you might want to check other people’s experiences with the help of Alison reviews. As I said, though, it's very subjective, so you can only see what other people think of it and what the majority of them indicate. Another way of making your own mind would be to take a look at the Alison YouTube channel. This way, you can get an objective opinion and see everything from your point of view.<br>
<span class="cut-off">Features</span><br>
The last point that this Alison online courses review is missing is the features. Now, since the overall experience of the majority of users was rather positive, let’s take a look at some features Alison has.

The first detail that caught my attention when I scrolled a little bit down the page is that the exact number of how many students are currently enrolled into courses, how many already graduated, how many courses there are at the moment, and the number of countries that have enrolled into Alison courses is provided.

The second thing is that you can refer your friend, or more particularly, as many friends as you want, and get free digital certificates and courses! This is great, right? Moving further into the feature part of Alison course review, it is important to say that there are 5 language preferences to choose from, including English, Spanish, French, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese.

There are also three hubs: English, Healthcare, and Project Management.

		         <p class="blog-desc">
			     <span class="high-light">Career platform Recruitday aims to upskill thousands of Filipinos for a career in tech</span><br>
				 Career platform Recruitday is proud to announce its rebranding to help Philippine tech talents connect to better opportunities and grow their career.<br>
				 <img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi8iIApCK6bsmCckzxWTXMbA0aP_RUI7jkZfHtN_XNPo64hk2gk2ndYx7SJeyXbWBtvj0mCROTBDkDCaCXc5lC8LnNqVjhb7TD0IXjhD3WtjBcMLtU63x19GB4-6ZYtejbxNtxaRvm-IGvBwBQdU2YJtnPAL4Cro_zsYguHu7bx2jCS_79TtRMwGAVoJw=s16000" alt="Recruitday  site " class="blog-img2" />
			     <br>
			 Recruitday recognizes that many Filipino workers want to work in tech-related roles, where the opportunities and career growth are. Yet there are many obstacles to completing the transition, such as skills mismatches and opportunity gaps.

Recruitday’s first initiatives to rebrand itself as a career platform focus on providing courses to help Filipinos excel in tech, rather than just listing job openings. With the pandemic retrenching workers from industries like hospitality and tourism, they needed a guide to help them shift to a more lucrative career path—which is what Recruitday aims to be. Both self-paced and instructor-led online courses teaching anything from the programming language of Python to cybersecurity analysis are now readily available on the platform.


                 <span class="cut-off">The platform will also now offer webinars, workshops, and trainings</span> all created with the goal of helping them land a tech job. All of these opportunities will help them join and connect with a community of like-minded people looking to grow their careers in the same industries.

“The digital transformation that was accelerated by the pandemic is showing us how crucial tech will be for the future,” said Recruitday CEO and Founder Joel Garcia. “But the reality is that there is a gap between supply and demand, with many Filipinos not yet equipped to work in the global tech landscape. We want to solve that.”

By helping opportunity seekers upskill themselves and move towards a more fulfilling career, Recruitday is going above and beyond the normal role of a job search platform.

Globally, hiring in tech-related roles is expected to continue enjoying impressive growth. In the US alone, employment in computer and tech-related roles is projected to grow 13% by 2030, with the rest of the world likely following suit. The apparent growth in tech is attractive for many looking for a career shift, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 22% of all workers have already done some sort of online tech training during the pandemic to boost their employability in an increasingly digital world.


Thus, even with all the opportunities readily available on its platform, Recruitday continues to work to find new ways to help opportunity seekers. This coming April, the platform plans to hold a career fair in the metaverse—the first of its kind in the Philippines.

“Because the metaverse allows people to meet and collaborate in virtual spaces, it’s set to have an outsize impact on the way we work,” Garcia explained. “Tools like MS Teams and Zoom have already shaped the way we work now and we believe the metaverse will have a much larger impact—we want Recruitday to be at the forefront of this change in the recruitment space.”

“Given the proper training and opportunities, Filipinos have a lot to offer,” concluded Garcia. “With Recruitday, we’ll hopefully start seeing more Filipinos in the global tech space soon.”<br>

		         <h1 class="blog-head">How to use AI to write blog posts—and should you?</h1><br>
		         <p class="blog-desc">
		   Blogging can be exhausting. Take it from someone who has spent nearly a decade blogging and has wasted far too much time staring at blank pages, willing the words to come.


And while the idea of relinquishing control to AI may still make some writers bristle, AI is an undeniably powerful tool for blogging. Whether you’re looking to use AI to draft entire blog posts or to finesse your writing, AI is useful for practically anyone looking to start a blog.


With all that said, there are several things you need to know about using AI to write your blogs. I am by no means suggesting that you let AI run your blog for you. Rather, AI can act as a good stand-in for a creative partner, serving as your second pair of hands and your second set of eyes. <br>
<span class="cut-off">When should you use AI to write your blog posts?</span><br>
No matter what type of website or blog you're building, AI tools have the potential to save you copious amounts of time when it comes to brainstorming, writing, editing and optimizing your content.  


AI is especially handy if you need to turn out a high volume of content on a consistent basis. Again, you shouldn’t rely on AI to run your entire content marketing strategy without supervision, but you can use different kinds of tools to help with research or to write long-form content.


For example, if you've got several topics lined up and a clear vision of the outlines, AI can swiftly turn your ideas into full-fledged articles—or at least get you 75% of the way there. Rather than starting a blog from scratch, you can use your AI draft as a starting point; you can focus your energy in editing and filling in any knowledge gaps. 


The aim is to enhance efficiency without compromising the quality and authenticity of your content. Make AI your ally, but keep your hands on the editing wheel for the best results.

However, AI isn’t a one-trick pony. It can do far more than simply draft your content. Let's explore all the ways you can use AI to enhance your blogs. 

<br>
<span class="cut-off">How to use AI to write your blog posts</span><br>
One of the best qualities of AI is its versatility. You can use AI to automate or refine several steps of the content production process, including (but not limited to) the following steps.

<br>
<mark>Generate your blog topic ideas</mark>
<br>
<mark>Research your topics </mark>
<br>
<mark>Construct outlines </mark>
<br>
<mark>Write your content </mark>
<br>
<mark>Serve as your proofreader </mark>
<br>
<span class="cut-off">Ethical considerations to keep in mind </span><br>
As excited as we are about AI’s advancement in blogging, you can probably sense our caution above. Let us explain: while AI can speed up your content creation process by taking a lot of the grunt work off your plate, it’s not something to apply blindly. 


The main issues with AI content is twofold: the output is dependent on what data it can draw from, and the content it delivers might not meet your editorial guidelines.


Since tools like ChatGPT pull from what’s already out there, you'll find that they piece together answers from its database. This may result in content that feels rehashed or somewhat stale.

This is why you need to edit any and all AI-generated content to protect your blog, plus avoid being penalized by Google. Google’s guidelines state that content must be helpful, whether or not it has been made with the help of AI.


If Google notices that your work has been cobbled together with AI without any unique angle, your site could potentially be marked as spam. That’s a big risk, especially for small business owners trying to build their online presence through blogging.


If you’re just building up your site from scratch, you'll need to dedicate time into finessing your approach to using AI for writing blog posts, since AI isn't great at generating content that demonstrates domain expertise for specific industries. For some complex, specialized fields, you'll need to give AI a huge helping hand because it can't grasp these topics as well as you can. This means its output won't be that helpful to your target audience.


Due to these limitations, here are a few things you should be wary of with AI-produced content:


Plagiarism: It’s possible for AI to write an entire blog post that closely mirrors your competitors' content. It's important to differentiate your article as best as possible with original research and content. You should also be careful not to accidentally taking credit for another author’s research or ideas, as this may be easy to do if you haven’t taken the time to carefully review AI-generated content.   


Accuracy: Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, himself has been spotted saying, “I trust answers generated by ChatGPT least than anybody else on Earth.” AI has recently been caught “hallucinating” facts about companies, sites and specific topics; fact-checking is absolutely essential to avoid a situation in which you might be propagating false information. 


Questionable authenticity: When AI is used to produce content, a question lingers—is the output genuinely yours? The ethical dilemma here lies in the potential erosion of personal voice and style. It's essential to retain your unique touch to make sure that your readers can relate and engage with your content.


Lack of innovation: Is utilizing AI for content creation viewed as pioneering, or does it reflect a lack of original input? To that end, you’ll want to avoid becoming over-reliant on AI or depending on it to form a unique opinion on your behalf. AI can spit back opinions already shared by another creator, but it does not substitute for original (or, at times, sensible) thinking, especially in the context of sensitive or controversial topics.  


Biases: As language learning models are trained based on their dataset, they may inherit biases in the data that can lead to skewed and unfair perspectives when writing. You need to stay vigilant for these biases that may result in unfair language or assumptions, however subtle, and edit your work to maintain equality.
